INFRASTRUCTURE

1. define the back-end configuration for our terraform remote state. make a folder called 1-infrustructure. 
--we will have 3 layers: 
    1. layer is infrastructure - define vpc and networking configuration for our subnets, security groups ...
    2. layer is the platform layer - where we define the ecs cluster, route 53 domain and everything inbetween 
    3. application layer where we define our task definition, fatgate application, everything related to the application


2. completed 1-infrustructure, executing terraform. 
-create production.tfvars file: in this file we are going to pass in the variables for the things that are missing within the variables.tf file
$ cd 1-infrastructure
-- backend is now being initialized by terraform 
$ terraform init -backend-config="infrastructure-prod.config" 

3. creating outputs.tf 
-- output some variables to the terraform roots state so that you can use them from the upper infrastructure layers 
-- first execute a plan so that we can see whats going to happen once we execute this terraform 
$ terraform plan -var-file="production.tfvars"

4. apply the following to our aws resources, and execute the plan 
$ terraform apply -var-file="production.tfvars"
